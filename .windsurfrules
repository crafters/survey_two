- use meaningful variable names
- keep functions small and focused
- follow consistent code style

# Elixir/Phoenix Backend
- always sort alias alfabetically
- group aliases by external deps, internal deps, and current app
- always use `alias` over `import` unless `import` is specifically needed
- always use `__MODULE__` when aliasing current module
- keep context modules focused and small
- name context functions with clear verbs (create_, update_, delete_)
- prefer pattern matching in function heads over conditionals
- use doctests for simple function documentation
- write clear module and function documentation

# Database/Ecto
- always define schema types explicitly
- always validate changesets
- define database constraints in migrations and changesets
- keep migrations small and focused
- name migrations with clear descriptive names
- use foreign key constraints
- use `@type t :: %__MODULE__{}` for schema types

# GraphQL/Absinthe
- define clear type names and descriptions
- group related queries and mutations in types
- handle errors consistently using middleware
- keep resolvers focused on data fetching
- avoid n+1 queries by avoiding associations in resolvers
- use dataloader for associations when strictly necessary

- validate input data at the schema level

# React Frontend
- always define prop types
- avoid prop drilling, use context when needed
- follow component naming conventions (PascalCase)
- group related components in folders
- keep components small and focused
- organize styles consistently
- use functional components over class components
- separate business logic from presentation

# Testing
- follow arrange-act-assert pattern
- test edge cases and error scenarios
- test happy paths comprehensively
- use descriptive test names
- use factories for test data with ex_machina importing the factory module
- no dinamyc loops in tests, preffer explicit code
